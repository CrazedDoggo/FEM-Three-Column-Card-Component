## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS animations
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Animations are great to add once the layout was completed. The slide-in animation was a very nice icing on the cake and made the components stand out.

This was my last "card" style exercise and I feel very comfortable with it. I'll be moving onto taking up 1-2 actual websites and then I'll be moving onto JavaScript if all goes well.
